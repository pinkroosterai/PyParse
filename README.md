# PyParser

PyParser is a command-line tool for analyzing Python source files. It extracts structured information about classes, functions, variables, and imports from your codebase and outputs the results as JSON. This is useful for code analysis, documentation generation, or tooling.

## Features

- Parses individual Python files or entire directories (recursively).
- Extracts:
  - Imports
  - Classes (with bases, decorators, methods, class variables, and triple-quoted string comments)
  - Functions (with arguments, decorators, and triple-quoted string comments)
  - Module-level variables
- Optionally includes base64-encoded source code for each entity.
- Outputs results as JSON, with an optional pretty-print mode.
- See [`output.schema.json`](output.schema.json) for the output format.

## Installation

Clone this repository and install dependencies (if any):

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-directory>
# (Optional) Install dependencies if required:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the CLI tool to analyze a Python file or directory:

```bash
python -m pyparser.cli <file_or_directory> [options]
```

### Options

- `-o, --output <file>`: Write output to a JSON file instead of printing to the console.
- `-p, --pretty`: Pretty-print the output JSON.
- `-r, --recursive`: If the input is a directory, recursively parse all `.py` files.
- `-c, --code`: Include base64-encoded source code for each file in the output.

### Examples

Parse a single file and print the result:

```bash
python -m pyparser.cli myscript.py
```

Parse a directory recursively and write pretty-printed output to a file:

```bash
python -m pyparser.cli myproject/ -r -o result.json -p
```

Parse a file and include base64-encoded code in the output:

```bash
python -m pyparser.cli myscript.py -c
```

## Output Format

The output is a JSON array, with one object per file. Each object contains metadata, imports, classes, functions, variables, and optionally the file's code.

### Comments and Docstrings

Triple-quoted string literals (including docstrings) are extracted and attached as a `"comment"` property to the nearest class or function node in the output. This allows you to access documentation or comments directly from the JSON.

See [`output.schema.json`](output.schema.json) for the full schema.
